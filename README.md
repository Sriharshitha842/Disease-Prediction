# Multiple Disease Prediction Model Using Ensemble Learning Model

**SUMMARY**

In this project, we utilized various symptoms as input parameters in machine learning to produce disease predictions. Built a machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier with that predicts a disease with an accuracy of 97.61% and saved the machine learning model in a pickle file and deployed the machine learning model using flask-ngrok in Google Colaboratory.
